## Basic info
Sudden Justice is a 3D prototype focusing on narrative and environmetal storytelling.

Date : Spring 2017

I wrote the script and designed the mechanic, my friend Zuo Chen programmed and finished the prototype. 

The game is set to tell a story about a drone pilot. I wanna discuss the personal struggle of a military drone operator who are often ordered to kill innocent people.
